title: The Rise of Elmo

I've started  watching Sesame Street with my son from time to time. I was stunned at how omnipresent Elmo has become. Elmo was already popular when I was a child (I was 6 when the Tickle Me Elmo dolls were released) but it seems to have reached a new level - it really feels like it has become the Elmo show, and every other character is secondary.

I wanted to see when this change happened, and exactly how large of a change it was. Unfortunately, episode scripts aren't available online to analyze. But the [muppet wiki](https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Sesame_Street) is very comprehensive and includes a detailed summary of every episode, segment by segment.

I scraped the wiki for every segment summary across the show's run and checked for the presence of characters' names.

The chart below conveys season averages -- for each season, on average, what percent of episode segments did that muppet appear in.

Although first introduced as a named character in 1980, Elmo really starts to pick up steam in the mid-80s, and by 1990 is clearly a popular character. By 1996, the year of the Tickle Me Elmo dolls, he's second only to big bird. But the last 20 years have been truly bananas. At this rate I expect in 2045 the entire show will just be a close-up of elmo's face for 30 minutes as he says his name over and over again.
